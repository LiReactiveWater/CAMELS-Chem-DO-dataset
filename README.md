# CAMELS-chem-dataset
The CAMELS-Chem dataset (Sterle et al., in preparation) is built as a stream chemistry supplement to the Catchment Attribute for Large Sample Studies that includes hydrologic, climatic, and catchment attributes (CAMESLS) (Addor et al., 2017; Newman et al., 2015). 

The newly developed dataset, CAMELS-Chem, compiles USGS water chemistry and instantaneous discharge from 1980 through 2014 in 493 headwater catchments. It includes common stream water chemistry related constituents (pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Cl, NO3, SO4, Si, HCO3, organic nitrogen, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, total organic carbon, and etc), as well as an overlapping set of annual wet deposition load from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (Br, Ca, Cl, H, K, Mg, N, Na, NH4, NO3, SO4).
