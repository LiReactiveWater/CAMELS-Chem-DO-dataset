# CAMELS-chem-dataset
The CAMELS-Chem dataset (Sterle et al., in preparation) is built as a supplement to the Catchment Attribute for Large Sample Studies that includes hydrologic, climatic, and catchment attributes (Addor et al., 2017; Newman et al., 2015). 

The newly developed dataset, CAMELS-Chem, compiles U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water chemistry and instantaneous discharge from 1980 through 2014 in 493 headwater catchments. It includes common stream water chemistry related constituents (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Cl, NO3, SO4, Si, N, total Nitrogen, HCO3, dissolved oxygen, pH, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), and water temperature), as well as an overlapping set of annual wet deposition load from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (Br, Ca, Cl, H, K, Mg, N, Na, NH4, NO3, SO4).
